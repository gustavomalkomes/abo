ABO: Automating Bayesian optimization with Bayesian optimization
=================================

This is an (messy) implementation of the method for automating (model selection in)
Bayesian optimization described in

> Malkomes, Gustavo; Garnett, Roman. Automating Bayesian optimization with
> Bayesian optimization (2018). Advances in Neural Information Processing
> Systems 31 (NeurIPS 2018)

This version of the code is not using the `active_gp_learning` package,
so it's still a little bit messy.

Feel free to send me an email at gustavo@sigopt.com;
Perhaps we can collaborate in a new version of this code. ;-)
